Note: when exporting a dashboard, the dashboard will be exported as a .json file.
That will be the raw dashboard structure for a single dashboard.
But the files here need to be:
 - wrapped in a `{"dashboard": {}}` object
 - have their id set to null in order to be created.

The setup script will post all the *.json files in this directory to the Grafana API.
